Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  Essentially I created two clocks, a 12-Hour and 24-Hour clock that displayed simultaneously and allowed for user modification through input. 
What did you do particularly well?
  I feel I made it pretty easy to use as well as make it look as accurate to what was given to me as a guide.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  Probably use more comments to make what I wrote clear to others who want to build or read upon it. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
