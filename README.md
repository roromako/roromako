# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  Essentially I created two clocks, a 12-Hour and 24-Hour clock that displayed simultaneously and allowed for user modification through input. 
  
# What did you do particularly well?
  I feel I made it pretty easy to use as well as make it look as accurate to what was given to me as a guide.
  
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  Probably use more comments to make what I wrote clear to others who want to build or read upon it. 
  
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? I guess the most challenging thing for me personally was making it look good using setw and setfill. I kept experimenting different things to see what worked and what didn't. It took longer than it should have. 
The tools and resources I personally use is online forums and communities, and a friend I have that works in the field. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Well they say if you're able to master one language, the others should be easier since they share similar fundamental concepts.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I started off small and just correcting any errors visual studio gave me. Anything I did not understand, I would just go back to the readings, as well as online to see what other people would do, and ask my buddy for advice on how I can improve or correct a certain mistake. I would also run it incrementally to make sure things worked.
